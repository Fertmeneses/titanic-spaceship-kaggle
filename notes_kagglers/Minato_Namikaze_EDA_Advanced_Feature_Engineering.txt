*** GENERAL ***

- Very nice format for tables:

"""
from prettytable import PrettyTable

table = PrettyTable()

table.field_names = ['Column Name', 'Data Type', 'Non-Null Count']
for column in train.columns:
    data_type = str(train[column].dtype)
    non_null_count = train[column].count()
    table.add_row([column, data_type, non_null_count])
print(table)
"""

- Pair plot, from seaborn, is a nice way to visualize pair-correlations:

"""
import seaborn as sns
sns.pairplot(data=train, vars=cont_cols, hue='Transported')
plt.show()
"""

*** FEATURE ANALYSIS ***

Quote, when analyzing numerical features Age and expenses:
""
Distributions between both the classes [True or False transported classes?] tell us that using these features directly into model would hinder the performance. These are the things that we could try:

- Create Bins
- Use algorithms that are unaffected by outliers
